  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Â¼ white onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
     <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
     <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to stir frequently.</li>
    <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
    <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
  </ol>
